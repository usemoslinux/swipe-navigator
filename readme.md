# Summary

Bring intuitive mobile-like navigation gestures to Firefox! Swipe from the left to go back, and from the right to go forward—with smooth animations and visual feedback.

# Description

Swipe Navigator makes browsing more fluid and natural by adding gesture-based navigation to Firefox, as seen on other popular mobile browsers, like Brave. This extension allows you to:

- Swipe right-to-left from the left edge to go back
- Swipe left-to-right from the right edge to go forward

As you swipe, a subtle animated icon appears to let you know which action is about to be triggered: a scaling back arrow, or a forward arrow—all styled to stay visible and separate from page content.

Designed with mobile devices in mind, but also works great on touch-enabled laptops and tablets. Lightweight, responsive, and works across all websites.

No settings. No ads. Just smooth gesture navigation.

# Permissions

Access to all sites is required to inject the gesture detection script and show visual feedback during your swipes.

# Compatibility

Works best on Firefox for Android or any touch-enabled device running Firefox.
